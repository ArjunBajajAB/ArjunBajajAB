I love the concept of coding and thus have learnt to code in different languages like C++, Java, Python, PHP, MySQL, Bootstrap, HTML and CSS. I am a keen learner who does not want to miss opportunities. Alongside coding, I love to spend my time gaming which helps me keep my mind fresh and focused. I am very good at debugging errors in a code though I have not done it professionally but have practiced it a school and college level. I also have in depth knowledge about deep learning, neural networks, CNNs,etc and have have developed some basic models using CNNs. 

I believe in the fact - 
"Alphabet O stands for OPPORTUNITY which is absent in YESTERDAY, available in TODAY and thrice in TOMORROW. Never Lose HOPE."
                                                                                                        - A.P.J. Abdul Kalam

I try to keep working according to this fact.
